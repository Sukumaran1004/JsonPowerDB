# JsonPowerDB


Here I have Implemented Student Enrollment Form Which Takes Input from the user and Save it into JSONPower Database Using JavaScript, netBeans and ajax.
JSONPowerDB is a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database. Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.

It is basically a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services.
